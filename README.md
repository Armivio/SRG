# Static Site Generator

A Python-based static site generator that converts Markdown files to HTML, similar to Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby. This project was created as part of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) learning path.

## Features

- Converts Markdown files to static HTML pages
- Supports common Markdown syntax:
  - Headers (h1-h6)
  - Bold and italic text
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Links and images
  - Ordered and unordered lists
  - Blockquotes
- Recursive directory processing
- Template-based page generation

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Armivio/SRG
cd static-site-generator
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.12.3 installed

## Usage

1. Add your Markdown content files to the `content` directory
2. Use the template.html file for page structure:
   - `{{ Title }}` - Will be replaced with the page title
   - `{{ Content }}` - Will be replaced with the page content

3. Run the generator and development server:
```bash
./main.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate the static site in the `public` directory
2. Start a development server at http://localhost:8888

Alternatively, just build without the server:
```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
./test.sh
```
or
```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s src
```

## Styling

The site comes with a built-in dark theme styled similarly to GitHub's dark mode, featuring:
- Dark background with light text
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Responsive design
- Styled blockquotes and links
- GitHub-like typography

## Development

The project uses an object-oriented approach with several key components:

- `HTMLNode`: Base class for HTML elements
- `TextNode`: Text content handler with support for various formats
- Block parsers for Markdown structures
- Recursive directory handling
- Development server for local testing

## Credits

This project was developed as part of the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) guided project "Build a Static Site Generator". 
The skeleton of the tests (and small bits of code where I could not solve the issues) were generated by ChatGPT o3-mini and o3-mini-high. However, heavy tinkering, modifications and adaptations were required for the tests (and the other bits of code) to be useful and correct.
Apart from that, all the code was written by me, during a ~3 day span.
